## CoinKeeperImporter

### It's a draft project!

CoinKeeperImporter is a tool for importing your budget data to CoinKeeper from other money tracking applications.

Currently, the import from Spendee app is implemented only.

The tool doesn't have a good UI yet. It's a kind of skeleton or PoC.
I needed to move my data from Spendee to CoinKeeper, but unfortunately the second one doesn't provide such functionality, so this project came up.

I am not working on this project now, because I've already solved my problem with this code. However, you can finish it, if you want so.

#### All contributions are welcome!
